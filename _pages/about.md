About me
======
I am pursuing a Master of Science in Control, Robotics, and Autonomous Systems (CRAS) with a minor in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence at Aalto University in Finland. My research interests broadly revolve around robotics, machine learning, and control theory. Currently, I am doing my Master's thesis under the guidance of Prof. Dominik Baumann, which focuses on developing learning-based event-triggered control mechanisms for networked multi-agent systems from pixels. I am also working as a research assistant with Prof. Ville Kyrki, where I am involved in migrating the robotic manipulation course codes to ROS2 and Mujoco 3.
