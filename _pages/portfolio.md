Foundation Models for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction
======
We developed a new approach for predicting pedestrian trajectories in autonomous driving scenarios using Vision Language Models (VLMs), which has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of intelligent transportation systems. By leveraging the power of VLMs to reason, infer, and generate text, the project can address some of the limitations of state-of-the-art methods and provide more comprehensive and interpretable predictions of pedestrian behaviour. This, in turn, can lead to the development of safer and more reliable autonomous systems.
