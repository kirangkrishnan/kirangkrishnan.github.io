## Foundation Models for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction
We developed a new approach for predicting pedestrian trajectories in autonomous driving scenarios using Vision Language Models (VLMs), which has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of intelligent transportation systems. By leveraging the power of VLMs to reason, infer, and generate text, the project can address some of the limitations of state-of-the-art methods and provide more comprehensive and interpretable predictions of pedestrian behaviour. This, in turn, can lead to the development of safer and more reliable autonomous systems.

## Bosch Future Mobility Challenge (BFMC) - f1tenth vehicle
BFMC is an international technical competition on developing autonomous driving and connectivity algorithms on 1/10 scale vehicles provided by the company to navigate in a designated environment simulating a miniature smart city. I was part of Team Aalto, representing the university in the competition and finished 6th out of 120 teams. The chassis of the car was provided by Bosch themselves. However, we modified the car with an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, which was used as the onboard computer. A nucleo board is used as the microcontroller to read the Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and control the motors. Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) was used as the middleware.
