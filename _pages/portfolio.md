## Foundation Models for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction
We developed a new approach for predicting pedestrian trajectories in autonomous driving scenarios using Vision Language Models (VLMs), which has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of intelligent transportation systems. By leveraging the power of VLMs to reason, infer, and generate text, the project can address some of the limitations of state-of-the-art methods and provide more comprehensive and interpretable predictions of pedestrian behaviour. This, in turn, can lead to the development of safer and more reliable autonomous systems.

## Bosch Future Mobility Challenge (BFMC) - f1tenth vehicle
BFMC is an international technical competition on developing autonomous driving and connectivity algorithms on 1/10 scale vehicles provided by the company to navigate in a designated environment simulating a miniature smart city. I was part of Team Aalto, representing the university in the competition and finished 6th out of 120 teams. The chassis of the car was provided by Bosch themselves. However, we modified the car with an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, which was used as the onboard computer. A nucleo board is used as the microcontroller to read the Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and control the motors. Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) was used as the middleware.

## River cleaning robot
This cleaning robot is equipped with two robotic wings actuated by servos and an underwater manipulator, allowing it to clean both surface and underwater areas. It supports both autonomous and manual operation modes. The robot is powered by an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 and two Arduino Mega boards. On the software side, ROS1 serves as the middleware, OpenCV is used for image processing tasks, and YOLOv5 is utilized for object detection.

## Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)
The robot was developed to compete in the Singapore AUV Challenge 2018. It was powered by an NVIDIA Jetson TK1 and two Arduino Mega boards. On the software side, ROS1 was used as the middleware, while OpenCV handled computer vision tasks. The robot was equipped with six thrusters, enabling five degrees of freedom. In the competition, we ranked among the top 20 teams out of 80 participants. After the competition, the robot was reconfigured and further developed into a river-cleaning robot.
